# What is a Type system?

> It is an easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has

> Every value has a type

For Example:

```
"red"
- It is a string
- It is a value that has all the properties and methods that we assume that a string has
```

## More on Types

Some examples

- String: "hi there", "", 'Today is monday'
- Number: .00025, -20, 4000000
- Boolean: True, False
- Date: new Date()
- Todo: {id: 1, completed: true, title: "Trash"}

## Types

- Primitive Types
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Void
  - Undefined
  - String
  - Symbol
  - Null
- Object Types (Any types that are created, or built into the language itself)
  - Functions
  - Arrays
  - Classes
  - Objects

**Why are there two categories?**

Using Object Types, we can make a code that will essentially trick typescript into believing that one value is a different type.

**Why do we care about Types?**

- Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase

## Example of Types

```typescript
const today = new Date();
today.getMonth();

//Here are the different properties and method this value has

const person = {
  age: 20,
};

class Color {}

const red = new Color();
```
