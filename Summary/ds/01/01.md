# Typescript Overview

Typescript = Javascript + A type system

### The TS Type System
- Helps us catch errors during development
- Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code (Type annotations = Little comments about the purpose of our code)
- Only active during development
- Doesn't provide any performance optimization

### How Typescript is run
- Typescript Code -> Typescript Compiler -> Plain old Javascript

### Summary
- Writing typescript is the same as writing Javascript with some "extra documentation"
- Typescript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or Node
- It is best to think of Typescript as being like a friend sitting behind you while you are coding and looking at every line of code you're writing and helping you catch errors.

# Environment Setup

### Typescript compiler install

```
npm install -g typescript ts-node
```

### Visual Studio Code setup

Optional
- Add 'code' to path
- Install Prettier Extension
- Run Prettier on save
- Use single quotes with prettier
- Use two spaces for indentation

# First Application

This exercise is to see roughly how TSC works.

1. Take a look at the API we'll use to fetch data
2. Create a new project directory
3. Create a package.json file
4. Install axios to make a request
5. Write code

API: [Link](jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

Use [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todo/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1)

### Make new project directory
```
mkdir fetchjson
cd fetchjson
```

### Make package.json
```
npm init -y
```

### Install axios
```
npm install axios
```

### Executing files
1. Make `index.ts` file
2. write the following code:
```
import axios from 'axios';

const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"

axios.get(url).then(response => {
    console.log(response.data)
})
```
3. Run compiler
```
tsc index.ts
```
4. Run the compiled js file
``` 
node index.js
```
5. To compile and run the code in one go
```
tsc-node index.ts
```

### Making the code better

1. Update the following code
```
import axios from 'axios';

const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"

axios.get(url).then(response => {
    const todo = response.data;

    const ID = todo.ID;
    const title = todo.Title;
    const finished = todo.finished;

    console.log(`
    The Todo with ID: ${ID}
    Has a title of: ${title}
    Is it finished? ${finished}
    `);
})
```

2. Run the code
3. There is an error. There are some mistakes with the property names
4. Typescript can prevent this mistakes
5.
