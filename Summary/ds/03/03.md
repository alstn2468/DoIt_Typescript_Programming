# Type Annotations in Action

## Type annotations and inference

Type annotation: Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to

Type inference: Typescript ties to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

```
The difference is that Type inference guesses the type, while Type annotations requires developers to manually add the type
```

## Annotations with variable

```typescript
let apples: number = 5;
let speed: string = "fast";
let hasName: boolean = true;

//type and value is same
let nothingMuch: null = null;
let nothing: undefined = undefined;

//built in objects
let now: Date = new Date();
```

- If you assign a variable that has a different type, it will cause an error

## Arrays, Classes, Object Literal Annotations

```typescript
// arrays
let colors: string[] = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];
let myNumbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let truths: boolean[] = [true, true, false];

// classes
class Car {}

let car: Car = new Car();

// object literal
let point: { x: number; y: number } = {
  x: 10,
  y: 20,
};
```

## Annotations around functions

```typescript
const logNumber: (i: number) => void = (i: number) => {
  console.log(i);
};
```

## Understanding Inference

If `declaration and initialization are on the same line`, Typescript will figure out the type for us.

**When to use Type inference**

- Always!

**When to use Type annotations**

- When a function returns the 'any' type and we need to clarify the value
- When we declare a variable on one line then initialize it later
- When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred

```typescript
// Function that returns the 'any' type
const json = '{"x": 10, "y":20}';
const coordinates = JSON.parse(json);
console.log(coordinates); // returns 'any' type
```

## The Any type
**'any' type**

- A type, just as 'string' or 'boolean' are
- Means TS has no idea what this is - can't check for correct property references
- Avoid variables with 'any' at all costs

To fix the above code:

```typescript
const json = '{"x": 10, "y":20}';
const coordinates: {x: number; y: number} = JSON.parse(json);
console.log(coordinates)
```

## Delayed Initialization

```typescript
//When we declare a variable on one line
let words = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
let foundWord: boolean;

for (let i = 0; i <words.length; i++>) {
    if (words[i] === 'green) {
        foundWord = true;
    }
}
```

## When Inference doesn't work

```typescript
//variable whose type cannot be inferred correctly
let numbers = [-10, -1, 12];
let numberAboveZero: boolean | number = false;

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++> {
    if (numbers[i] > 0) {
        numberAboveZero = numbers[i]
    }
})
```

- You can use the `|` symbol to assign multiple types for a variable
